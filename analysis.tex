	\subsection{Something Needs To Be Done}

		\paragraph {Users are weary of tracking}

One of the most troubling aspects to the issue of privacy on mobile devices is the gaping distance between consumers' expectations of privacy and the actual reality of privacy on smartphones. In a survey carried out in 2012, 78 percent of cell phone users think that their personal data such as contact lists, location data, name, address, etc, is at least as private as the data on their home computers\cite{Jenn2012}. This finding has a small caveat in that it assumes the survey respondents consider their home computers to be private, but this hardly seems like a controversial claim. If that is the case, then it would follow that the majority of smartphone users regard their personal information as secure and private.

% This argument alone could stand to reason that the notice and choice framework is failing the average consumer based on the fact that they are unaware of the privacy implications in the use of smartphone applications. 

In reality, underneath the hood of the mobile ecosystem, many applications obtain and use personal information on a regular basis. 
A study done by The Wall Street Journal analyzed 101 popular apps and showed that 56 applications sent the phone's unique identifier to third parties without notice or consent\cite{Thru2010}. Many of these applications also attached many other types of personal data to the unique identifiers such as contacts, age, and gender before sending them to various companies. Since then, however, many of the application developers outed by the publication have adopted privacy policies. While it is beneficial to have the privacy practices documented in this form, the very mechanism of notice and choice is failing the average consumer, a point discussed further on. 

		\paragraph {Growth patterns}

Despite the fact that consumer awareness is rising with respect to data collection on mobile platforms, the trends of collection and aggregation continues to rise\cite{Source}. This can not be taken as suprise as advertising networks have largely been given the go ahead from a legal perspective. The commonly cited case bieng DoubleClick vs Bose determined difinitively that tracking a user's behavior amongst multiple contexts cannot be ciminalized as long as that collection is not tortious\hl{FACT CHECK}. 
Certianly, the demand placed on targeted advertising via ad networks is not going to go away. Thus, we will continue to see \hl{data collection} companies compete and innovate over ways to more efficiently and more preciscly pinpoint your interests and thus, your suceptibility to interact with an advertisement. 


		\paragraph {Privacy Dangers}

One of the more violating practices that is emerging is the use of location data to serve more relevant ads to consumers. 

	\subsection{Current Policy is not Working}

		\paragraph{Overview of current protections}
The current legal landscape surrounding the privacy of mobile data collection is a generaly passive one except in certain circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the agency responsible for bringing suits against companies that do not abide by privacy law. Of course their powers only go as far as current statutes allow. There are only a few statutes that can be applied to the issues of smartphone data collection as it occurs in the context of advertising purposes. 

Initially, in an attempt to better understand the industry\cite{wsj2011} and possibly to induce companies to publish privacy policies, the FTC carried out a criminal investigation on mobile app developers under the pretenses of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In particular, the investigation centered around the question of weather the collection of a users personal information through a smartphone without the users notice or consent would be covered by the CFAA. Ultimately the investigation did not lead to any suits, however it did prompt mobile app developers to take the issue of publishing privacy policies more serioiusly\hl{not sure}. 

One case where the FTC had success in bringing actions against mobile data collection, was in a case involving the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The act requires parental consent before collecting or sharing any information about any child under the age of 13. The lawsuit identified a number of companies that clearly marketed their applications to children and then collected emails and allowed users, mainly children, to post to the interent in the form of blogs among other things\cite{ftc2011}. The defendants quickly settled to the tune of \$50,000. 


		\paragraph{Why notice and choice is pursued}

For the general case of tracking adults through application use, the FTC has fallen back to the concept of notice and choice for regulation.

While this paper does not attempt to focus on the issues related to web browser tracking, there is one parallel that is particularly useful from that realm. That is the use of what is called the `Flash' cookie, or `Supercookie'. These are types of cookies that are very difficult to delete because they can re-spawn themselves.
