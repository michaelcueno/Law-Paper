\section{Conclusion}

If consumers are made aware of the privacy implications in a simple and transparent notice and then given a choice that does not bar them from participating in mobile services, the theory of notice and choice would be more aligned with its use in practice. 
The combination of a more privacy concerned mobile operating system market and appropriate personal data regulation will result in a much more private experience for the average smartphone user.
