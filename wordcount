Privacy issues on smartphone platforms in the United States have been likened
to the Wild West due to a lack of direct regulation [1] and very little consumer
awareness [2]. As more users leave traditional consumption outlets such as
TV, print and even web browser for mobile consumption [3], more research and
development goes into procedures for tracking behaviors on these platforms.
We have seen a healthy debate for consumer protection in the realms of
web browser privacy with the introduction of do not track mechanisms [4] and
default settings which block third party tracking cookies [5]. The success of
these developments can be argued, but the presence of a conversation and
and beginnings of processes to deal with the privacy issues are encouraging.
Unfortunately, it is less clear if the same thing can be said about the privacy
issues in the mobile arena. Attribution for this can go, in part, to a lack of
consumer awareness of the tracking practices that are carried out on mobile
devices [2]. This is increasing alarming as today s smartphones have access
to much more personal data sets than do your typical web browser, such as
contact lists, text messages and location data to name a few.
The void of consumer awareness is begining to be filled with a growing
number of publications that focus on current practices in mobile data collec-
tion. The Wall Street Journal, for example, has devoted an entire series to the
issue [6]. I argue that as consumer awareness increases, so too will the demand
for privacy on mobile platforms. This relationship is supported by a recent
study [7], showing that over the past year, 72 percent of smartphone users
are more concerned about privacy and 81 percent choose to avoid applications
that they think will not protect their privacy.
This paper illustrates the privacy implications that arise from the collection
of personal, mobile data and suggests a two tiered approach to solving the issue.
First, from a tecnhological, industry regulated perspective, and secondly, with
some suggestions for leglislation to plug the holes that cannot be filled with
the technological approach.

2.1
Background
Evolution of Behavioral Tracking
Over the years, advertising networks have competed to increase the granularity
on their target groups to what is now, in certain cases, an individual bias. A
market has sprung up with devilish speed to compete for access to personal
information which can be sold as profiles to the highest bidders, typically
advertising networks [8]. This practice is known as behavioral tracking and it
got its start from the third party cookie used in web browsers.
This unique character string lives under the hood of modern web browsers
and can be used for legitimate reasons such as keeping users logged into a ses-
sion with their bank ́
s website, but the technology can also be used to collect
data about consumers across many different sites. The use of cookies to per-
form behavioral tracking has exploded in recent years and shows no signs of
slowing down [9].
As the use of mobile platforms increase, so too will the market for personal
data on mobile devices. A recent survey found that smartphone and tablet
users watch, on average, 30 percent less TV and consume even less print media
[3]. This shift in consumption patterns along with the tantalizing personal data
sets that mobile devices offer, have pushed advertisers to invest heavily into
mobile tracking technologies for the purposes of behavioral advertising [10].
2.2 Technical Discussion of Behavioral Tracking on
SmartPhones
A majority of tracking on mobile platforms is done through the applications
that users download through their respective application vendors, most com-
monly, the Android Market and the App store from Apple. These applications
often obtain access to permissioned data such as age, gender, location and the
devices unique identifier. For smartphones running the Android OS, this is
typically the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) and for Apple
devices it is the UDID.
Application developers can access this identifier and send application usage
4statistics along with other permissioned data, such as contact lists or location
data, to advertising networks. When multiple applications send data to the
same networks, all using the same identifier, a secret dossier can be established
and maintained by that ad network for each device [11]. These unique profiles
that can reveal very personal things about a user such as political affiliation
or even sexual preferences [12].
A troubling aspect to the use of these unique identifiers is that they cannot
be cleared or reset on a device much like cookies on a web browser can. In fact,
some countries have made it illegal to change, or spoof, these unique identifiers
for anti-theft reasons. [13] This is in part, what makes smartphone tracking so
appealing to advertisers. They are guaranteed a persistent way to identify an
individual across multiple contexts.
At the moment the only technical protection that users have against this
type of tracking procedure is through permission awareness from the appli-
cation vendors. The Android market for example, informs users what types
of data applications will access via a permissions screen prior to download-
ing the application. This is accomplished because Android makes developers
request permission to all the data and resources that the application will re-
quire. The problem is that the average user is unaware of the security and
privacy implications behind the permissions screen. Also, the permissions are
commonly not read, and instead seen as a click through screen to installing an
application [14].
Web Browsing vs. Application Data. An important distiction must
be made between the two ways that personal data can be collected on mobile
devices. In particular, data can be gathered through mobile web browsing
or through the various applications that a user may install on their device.
Although IOS blocks third party cookies, most android browsers along with
Firefox s mobile browser do not [15]. Even in the case where thrid party cookies
are disabled, there are various ways in which profilers can track a user through
the mobile web browser. These techniques include ‘device fingerprinting’ [16]
and leveraging a loophole in the Safari browser [17] among a few other methods
[15].
These two seperate domains cause problems for advertising networks and
5consumers alike. Since they are indeed disjoint domains, a single device can
appear to be two different users, one profile for mobile web and one for applica-
tion use. So far the only documented way of connecting these two profiles is by
having a user click through an in-app-advertisement which loads in that user s
browser while carrying along some metadata to link two profiles together [15].
However, the majority of data gathered in the mobile realm is through ap-
plication use and not through browsing [18]. For this reason along with the
fact that behavioral tracking through mobile web browsing is not a novel issue
that is brought up through analysing privacy in the mobile ecosystem, for the
remainder of this paper, we will only concern ourselves with the application
tracking domain.
2.3
Novel Issues to the Smartphone Case
Small screen size One significant problem that advertisers must combat
when to catering smartphones, is the small form factor. Even while the norm
for screen sizes seems to be falling into equilibrium around larger, more pixel
dense screens [19], they are much smaller than other delivery systems such
as laptops and tablets. This can make typical advertisements such as banners
become overly obtrusive. Ads loose their effectiveness when they are perceived
as a hindrance by the user [20]; a very easy line to cross given the small and
precious real estate on a typical smartphone.
Advertisers have been struggling with how to make effective use of the
small screen size ever since the consumers’ adoption of the smartphone. In
part, this issue explains the large gap between consumer usage and advertising
dollars spent on mobile which was an estimated ‘opportunity loss’ (uncollected
advertising revenue) of $20 billion dollars in May of 2012 [10]. But while
banner adverts still frequent many apps, companies are starting to use less
conventional methods for delivering ads. Some techniques include notifications
through the phone’s operating system, rich media advertising, and audio ads
where they can be applied. As the mobile advertising ecosystem matures, the
methods of ad delivery will depart from the obtrusive, scaled down versions of
web page ads and become more intimately tied to the phone’s platform.
Another characteristic of smartphones that distinguish them from other
6devices, is that they are very commonly used by only one individual, always
on and nearly always with that individual. This makes them very attractive to
the advertising ecosystem in that each device can be regarded as one specific
person.
Already, we can see some examples of companies leveraging the smart-
phone’s novel characteristics to create a more seductive advertising impression
on consumers. Some emerging startups, for example, are commonly using lo-
cation based information to provide services. Square, a payment system and
competitor to Google wallet, uses location data to identify when a customer
has entered a store and sends that information to the merchant along with
previous shopping history so that merchant can better prepare for their trans-
action [21]. This type of innovation has great implications for efficiency and
customer satisfaction, but it also creates the externalities of private data sets
that have a very high appeal to advertising networks. In fact, Square’s pri-
vacy policy states that it will collect location, transaction and other types of
data from users and share that personally-identifiable information with third
parties such as advertising networks [22].
Location data is the fourth most important aspect to whether a consumer
will interact with an advertisement, falling underneath coupons, previous shop-
ping history and favorite brands [3]. A company called AdNext has already
begun to capitalize on the insight that location data can provide. Using lo-
cation data gathered by wireless access points in one of South Koreas largest
malls, COEX Mall, to build prediction models for the patrons, AdNext was
able to deliver an ad based on the perceived next location of that patron [23].
The benefits of this approach are lucratively appealing to advertising com-
panies and thus with the current legal climate and growth of location based
services, a large market force is created around aggregating personal location
data for the use of direct advertising.
Conclusion Despite its small screen size, the smartphone is becoming more
and more attractive to advertisers as a platform. One of the best metrics
to measure the success and exposure of advertisements is through what is
known in the industry as the CPI (Cost Per Impression). This is the cost that
advertisers must pay each time that an ad is served. Often this statistic is
7reported per one thousand impressions, or cost per milli (CPM). The average
CPM across website banners is a rough statistic as it varies widely based on
niche and exposure, however, for reference, in 2012 it was $2.66 [24]. For
name brand sites such as yahoo.com, cars.com and others, the standard 300 X
250 advertisement is sold for $7.00. Interestingly, advertisers can tack on an
extra $9.00 for behavioral targeted ads [25] Compare this to a recent report
from Opera Software which states that the IPhone pulls in a $2.85 CPM while
phones running the Android OS received an average of $2.10 CPM [26]. The
report continues to extrapolate that rich media, screen resolution and better
user interactivity drive the CPM rate. Certainly, as smartphone technology
continues to grow, so too will these characteristics. Thus, the current trends
suggest that even with its weaknesses, the smartphone will become a more
dominant advertising delivery device in comming years.

Evaluation
One of the most troubling aspects to the issue of privacy on mobile devices
is the gaping distance between consumers’ expectations of privacy and the
actual reality of privacy on smartphones. In a survey taken last year, 78
percent of cell phone users think that their personal data such as contact
lists, location data, name, address, etc, is at least as private as the data on
their home computers [2]. This finding has a small caveat in that it assumes
the survey respondents consider their home computers to be private, but this
hardly seems like a controversial claim. If that is the case, then it would follow
that the majority of smartphone users regard their personal information as
secure and private.
In reality, underneath the hood of the mobile ecosystem, many applications
obtain and use personal information on a regular basis. A study done by The
Wall Street Journal analyzed 101 popular apps and showed that 56 applications
sent the phone’s unique identifier to third parties without notice or consent [11].
Many of these applications also attached many other types of personal data to
the unique identifiers such as contacts, age, and gender before sending them to
various companies. Since then, however, many of the application developers
outed by the publication have adopted privacy policies. While it is beneficial
8to have the privacy practices documented in this form, the very mechanism of
notice and choice is failing the average consumer, a point discussed further on.
3.1
Current Policy and Legislation
The current legal landscape surrounding the privacy of mobile data collection
is a generally passive one except in certain circumstances. The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) is the agency responsible for bringing suits against compa-
nies that do not abide by privacy law. Of course their powers only go as far as
current statutes allow. There are only a few statutes that can be applied to the
issues of smartphone data collection as it occurs in the context of advertising
purposes.
Initially, in an attempt to better understand the industry [6] and possibly
to induce companies to publish privacy policies, the FTC carried out a criminal
investigation on mobile app developers under the pretenses of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In particular, the investigation centered around
the question of whether the collection of a user’s personal information through
smartphone applications without the user’s notice or consent could be consid-
ered computer fraud. Ultimately, the investigation did not lead to any suits,
however, it did prompt mobile app developers to take the issue of publishing
privacy policies more seriously.
One case where the FTC had success in bringing actions against mobile
data collection, was in a case involving the Children’s Online Privacy Pro-
tection Act (COPPA). The act requires parental consent before collecting or
sharing any information about any child under the age of 13. The lawsuit
identified a number of companies that clearly marketed their applications to
children and then collected emails and allowed users, mainly children, to post
to the Internet in the form of blogs among other things [27]. The defendants
quickly settled to the tune of $50,000.
For the general case of tracking adults through application use however,
the FTC does not seem to want to push its weight around. Although
the FTC states five principals in regards to fair information practices, no-
tice/awareness, choice/consent, access/participation, integrity/security and
enforcement/redress, they have, in practice not pursued them equally with
9the same rigor. In part due to a recognition of the importance of the free flow
of information in today’s economy [28] they have fallen back, almost entirely,
to upholding the principals of notice and choice. Also, the commission’s con-
cept of notice includes in it common themes of many other fair information
privacy principals such as the APEC privacy framework’s collection limitation
and uses of personal information which limits the collection and use of per-
sonal data to only that which is relevant [29]. In other words, the FTC punts
on the concepts of fair use and collection by allowing notices to waive them.
Effectually, the commission’s approach allows for contractual like notices, that
can contain anything the drafting party desires, no matter how “unfair” the
practices [29].
In practice, the FTC has a limited arsenal of weaponry to combat the
privacy issues raised on smartphones. The enforcement strategy that they
have adopted has been to encouraged companies and mobile app developers
to publish privacy policies and then to pursue those entities that violate their
policies.
3.2
Failures of notice and choice
The theory of notice and choice for protecting consumer privacy is a wonderful
solution to a very real problem. However, when applied to mobile applications,
its practical implementation is truly horrendous. Notices are often full of
legal jargon and verbose to the point that many consumers do not bother
to read them [30]. They also frequently are not even seen by the consumer,
instead implicitly agreed upon through using the application. Furthermore,
applications are not required to post privacy policies and many applications
simply do not [11]. This sums to a situation where the user of the app is unable
to make an informed decision on whether to accept the trade-off of allowing
access to personal information with the service of the app.
Even if notices are provided and clear, the implementation of choice is also
troubling. The only mechanism of choice that a user is given when confronted
with an application that does not align with their privacy preferences is to
not use that application. Assuming that the user chooses not to use that
application based solely on its privacy policies, there is rarely an alternative to
10that application that differs only in the way it handles privacy. For instance,
if a consumer wishes use Amazon as their mobile, online shopping outlet, but
disagrees with it’s terms of service or privacy policy, there are not likely to
be any other online shopping applications that offer their services without
burdening the user to agree to a similar privacy policy [31]. Thus, the privacy
concerned user makes not only the choice to not use the app, but the choice
to not use any application that offers a similar service.
Ideally, notice and choice would allow consumers to make informed de-
cisions about the services and third parties that they expose their data to.
Consumers would be aware of the complex ways that their data would pro-
mulgate through the advertising ecosystem and could more readily make an
informed decision to consent or deny those practices without being barred from
the service in the case of the latter outcome. Unfortunately, the ideal is far
from achieved in practice as noted earlier, and we are left with a void of con-
sumer awareness and a lack of any meaningful choice and instead consumers
use applications and allow them to collect their personal data through passive
acquiescence [32].

Prescription
Care must be taken when approaching the mobile ecosystem through the leg-
islative lens of privacy control. Certainly, draconian measures that would limit
application developers from collecting any personal information would be dev-
astating to the industry. Many applications must use this type of data for
the legitimate purposes of creating accounts for users and providing other ser-
vices. On the other hand, the current legal climate of notice and choice is not
sufficient in protecting the privacy of consumers in the mobile realm. Further-
more, with the lack of consumer awareness, the demand placed on privacy is
not a strong enough market force to cause change in the mobile application
industry. Therefore, policy in conjunction with consumer advocates must step
in to better protect consumer privacy on the smartphone.
114.1
Dangers of Explicit Statutes
One danger that must be mentioned when addressing any regulation regarding
the gathering of smartphone data is the possible societal impacts of limiting
the use of such data. Certainly, not all data uses are evil. Many important dis-
coveries and innovations would not have been possible without the unrestricted
access to personal data.
In one case, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health carried out a
study in Kenya that consisted of analyzing the location data of nearly 15 mil-
lion mobile phones to try and understand the infection patterns of malaria [33].
The study found that human travel carried the infection more so than travel
by mosquitoes, and that the spread of the infection followed stable patterns
every year. Ultimately, the study identified areas where malaria treatment
centers would be most effective, and infection rates have gone down %25 since
2000 due targeted prevention.
Clearly, some uses of mobile data can benefit an entire population, and as
such, any policy implemented should not block the legitimate uses of personal,
mobile data when the user consents to its use. As a result, legislation should
emphasize the prevention of harm in the use of personal data and not crimi-
nalize the mere ownership of personal data sets as long as they were acquired
through legitimate processes.
4.2
Technological Solution
Any regulation that uses specific, technological requirements in its language
would become anachronistic rather quickly as technology advances. Thus, any
statute attempting to resolve privacy issues specific to smartphones should be
avoided. Instead, the FTC can use its influence to push recommendations
and best practices onto the mobile ecosystem in order to achive an industry
regulated atmosphere.
Possibly under threat of creating what is known as a Trade Rule, the FTC
could push mobile phone platforms to create better privacy controls for the
phones that they run on. Since data collection occurs through the operating
system of the mobile phone via permissioned access to specific data sets, the
operating system is in the best position to block the application of these data.
12Apple’s IOS 6 has made great progress in this direction, offering users a
privacy control panel. The panel options start with the different types of data
that may be collected, location and contacts for example, and upon tapping
a specific data type, IOS 6 shows the user all the applications that request
access to that data. The user can then, app by app, grant or revoke access
to that application’s use of the data. This kind of control is applauded by
privacy advocates and models exactly the kind of innovative solutions that
only the operating system creators can provide. The very existence of this
kind of control would allow consumers to be more aware of the data collection
practices of certain applications.
Currently, Android users are only made aware of the types of data that
an application will collect when they initially download the application. As
mentioned previously, the user typically does not pay attention to these notices
nor have a choice other than to be excluded from using the service that the
application provides if they disagree with the practices. With good privacy
controls in place however, the mechanism of notice and choice becomes more
effective because the user can choose to still use the application, but in a way
that retains her privacy preferences.
As the consumer is more easily able to deny applications the data that
they request, application will need to make more clear and concise arguments
for the use of that data in order to persuade the consumer to grant access to
personal data sets. This approach has the extra benefit of making notices more
human readable since now the drafting party is creating the notice directly for
the consumer and not for a lawyer. It follows then, that users will become
more aware of the value that their data holds and thus will be able to make a
more informed choice.

Regulatory Solution
While this type of technological approach works great to protect consumers
against data leakage from specific data sets such as location data, it is inher-
ently limited by the technology that implements it. For instance, any data that
the user supplies to the application directly, username, email, date of birth or
application usage statistics for example, cannot be blocked by the operating
system short of cutting off network usage from the application. However, if
this type of limitation where implemented it would make it extremely difficult
for application developers to create useful applications as many applications
fundamentally require access to the network.
Another area that any technological approach could not influence is the
process of what happens to personal data after the point of collection. If an
application user decides to allow some app access to her location data in order
to get directions home, she would be offered no protection against how that
data is used in the future. These holes in the solution beg resolution through
regulation.
Suggestions on Policy formation
The focus on notice and choice in the United States for dealing with privacy
issues in the mobile realm have resulted in a legal climate that emphasizes
bureaucratic legislation which places extra costs on consumers and business,
instead of encouraging enhanced privacy protection . What is required, is
a shift in the enforcement strategy undertaken by the FTC to promote the
fair use of collected personal information, rather than the current approach
of promoting privacy policies and then bringing allegations against companies
who offend their policies.
Spelling out the exact components required for effective legislation is be-
yond the scope of this paper. Fortunately, encouraging work is being done
with respect to privacy legislation in what has become known as the Con-
sumer Data Bill of Rights . In this report, seven privacy principals are
detailed pertaining to the commercial use of personal data. I will outline the
suggestions in that report and try to extend them to cover any issues that may
be novel to the smartphone.
Any legislation dealing with data collected through a smart phone should
make the distinction between personally identifiable and anonymized data.
Here, personally identifiable, would mean any data connected to a name, email
address, device unique identifier or any other information that could link the
data to a specific person or device. Furthermore, no legislation should be
put forth that attempts to regulate the use of anonymous data due to the
problematic externalities that would arise from such a practice. Anonymous
data is often used for research that is beneficial to society with no harm to
the individuals that provide the data  Also, by its nature, anonymous
data could never be used to collect damages if a company was to violate any
legislation surrounding the use of such data since it could not be proven to
actually belong to a plaintiff. Therefore, any statute constructed should only
deal with personally identifiable information.
Currently, applications do not need to publish a privacy policy, they are
only encouraged by the FTC to do so. To improve transparency, policy should
be put in place to require any application or service that uses personal data
to create a privacy policy and obtain consent from the user before collecting
data. To avoid any chilling effect that such regulation may have on startup
companies, a clause could be added which excludes any application or service
with less than 10,000 users from abiding.
To promote the enhancement of privacy protection within the commercial
realm, the FTC should be given enforcement grounds to pursue companies
who do not adequately secure the personal data that they collect. Statutes
could be put in place that create liability for companies whose data sets are
compromised in conjunction with appropriate negligence in securing that data.
Consumers should also be protected against the long term, and unintended
uses of their personal data. Any privacy legislation should consider enact-
ing a proper way of allowing consumers to dispose of personal data sets from
applications upon the termination of their accounts or services. Given the
complexities of the mobile and online advertising ecosystem, it would be in-
credibly difficult to ensure that all traces of personal data collected through a
specific application are appropriately deleted. In light of this fact, the mech-
anism of notice will need to be sufficient in informing the consumer that any
data shared with third parties would not fall under this regulation.

Notable Current Developments
Currently, there is some encouraging debates and conversations happening in
the legislative sector with regards to mobile privacy. One such development
is a bill introduced by representative Hank Johnson called the Application
Privacy, Protection, and Security (or APPS) Act. This bill would make notices
of privacy procudures mandatory for mobile applications, provide opt-out and
deletion measures to consumers, and put in place statutes for the security of
any collected personal data
Also, the Obama administration has put forth what it is reffering to as the
Consumer Data Bill of Rights. It contains legislative suggestions to congress
which specify the core pricipals that are common to many other fair informa-
tion privacy practices . It will be interesting to see if any privacy legislation
materializes out of that report.

Conclusion
If consumers are made aware of the privacy implications in a simple and trans-
parent notice and then given a choice that does not bar them from participating
in mobile services, the theory of notice and choice would be more aligned with
its use in practice. The combination of a more privacy concerned mobile op-
erating system market and appropriate personal data regulation will result in
a much more private experience for the average smartphone user.
