Smartphone and tablet platforms in the US have been caught in a privacy snafu
with respect to behavioral tracking due to a lack of direct regulation [1] and
very little consumer awareness [2]. As more users leave traditional consumption
outlets such as TV, print and even web browser for mobile consumption [3],
more research and development goes into procedures for tracking behaviors on
these platforms.
We have seen a healthy debate for consumer protection in the realms of
web browser privacy with the introduction of do not track mechanisms [4] and
default settings which block third party tracking cookies [5]. The success of
these developments can be argued, but the presence of a conversation and
and beginnings of processes to deal with the privacy issues are encouraging.
Unfortunately, it is less clear if the same thing can be said about the privacy
issues in the mobile arena. Attribution for this can go, in part, to a lack of
consumer awareness of the tracking practices that are carried out on mobile
devices [?]. This is increasing alarming as today s smartphones have access
to much more personal data sets than do your typical web browser, such as
contact lists, text messages and location data to name a few.
The void of consumer awareness is begining to be filled with a growing
number of publications that focus on current practices in mobile data collec-
tion. The Wall Street Journal, for example, has devoted an entire series to the
issue [6]. I argue that as consumer awareness increases, so too will the demand
for privacy on mobile platforms. This relationship is supported by a recent
study [7], showing that over the past year, 72 percent of smartphone users
are more concerned about privacy and 81 percent choose to avoid applications
that they think will not protect their privacy.
This paper illustrates the privacy implications that arise from the collection
of personal, mobile data and suggests an approach to solving the issue from a
policy standpoint.

Background
Evolution of Behavioral Tracking
Over the years, advertising networks have competed to increase the granularity
on their target groups to what is now, in certain cases, an individual bias. A
market has sprung up with devilish speed to compete for access to personal
information which can be sold as profiles to the highest bidders, typically
advertising networks SOURCE . This practice is known as behavioral data
tracking and it got its start from the third party cookie used in web browsers.
This unique character string lives under the hood of your web browser and
can be used for legitimate reasons such as keeping you logged into a session
with your banks website, but the technology can also be used to collect data
about you across many different sites. The use of cookies to perform behavioral
tracking has exploded in recent years and shows no signs of slowing down [8].
The migration to smart phones As the use of mobile platforms in-
crease, so too will the market for personal data on mobile devices. A recent
survey found that smartphone and tablet users watch, on average, 30 percent
less TV and consume even less print media [3]. This shift in consumption pat-
terns along with the tantalizing personal data sets that mobile devices offer,
have pushed advertisers to invest heavily into mobile tracking technologies for
the purposes of behavioral advertising SOURCE .
2.2 Technical Discussion of Behavioral Tracking on
SmartPhones
A majority of tracking on mobile platforms is done through the applications
that users download through their respective application vendors, most com-
monly, the Android Market and the App store from Apple. These applications
often obtain access to permissioned data such as age, gender, location and the
devices unique identifier. For smartphones running the Android OS, this is
typically the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) and for Apple
devices it is the UDID.
4Application developers can access this identifier and send application usage
statistics along with other permissioned data to advertising networks. When
multiple applications send data to the same networks, all using the same iden-
tifier, a secret dossier can be established and maintained by that ad network
for each device SOURCE .
A troubling aspect to the use of these unique identifiers is that they cannot
be cleared or reset on a device much like cookies on a web browser can. In fact,
some countries have made it illegal to change, or spoof, these unique identifiers
for anti-theft reasons. SOURCE This is in part, what makes smartphone
tracking so appealing to advertisers. They are guaranteed a persistent way to
identify an individual across multiple contexts.
At the moment the only technical protection that users have against this
type of tracking procedure is through permission awareness from the appli-
cation vendors. The Android market for example, informs users what types
of data applications will access via a permissions screen prior to downloading
the application. This is accomplished because Android makes developers re-
quest permission to all the data and resources that the application will require.
The problem is that the average user is unaware of the security and privacy
implications behind the permissions screen source . Also, the permissions are
commonly not read, and instead seen as a click through screen to installing an
application. SOURCE
Web Browsing vs. Application Data. An important distiction must
be made between the two ways that personal data can be collected on mobile
devices. In particular, data can be gathered through mobile web browsing
or through the various applications that a user may install on their device.
Although IOS blocks third party cookies, most android browsers along with
Firefox s mobile browser do not [9]. Even in the case where thrid party cookies
are disabled, there are various ways in which profilers can track a user through
the mobile web browser. These techniques include ‘device fingerprinting’ [10]
and leveraging a loophole in the Safari browser [11] among a few other methods
[9].
These two seperate domains cause problems for advertising networks and
consumers alike. Since they are indeed disjoint domains, a single device can
5appear to be two different users, one profile for mobile web and one for applica-
tion use. So far the only documented way of connecting these two profiles is by
having a user click through an in-app-advertisement which loads in that user s
browser while carrying along some metadata to link two profiles together [9].
However, the majority of data gathered in the mobile realm is through appli-
cation use and not through browsing source . For this reason along with the
fact that behavioral tracking through mobile web browsing is not a novel issue
that is brought up through analysing privacy in the mobile ecosystem, for the
remainder of this paper, we will only concern ourselves with the application
tracking domain. there’s a better way to phrase this..
This is the kind of data collection that keeps privacy advocates awake at
night.
Differences between Web Browser Tracking and Smartphone tracking
The difference between traditional behavioral tracking through the use of
third party cookies and the way that it is done via smartphones and tablets
through applications is an important technical point that has implications on
policy and privacy. In the case of cookies, the user has the ability to delete
them and thus clear out the data that tracks them. NOT REALLY
In some cases, companies have used the unorthodox flash cookie, also known
as a super cookie, which is able to respawn regular cookies after they have been
deleted
2.3
Novel Issues to the Smartphone Case
Small screen size One significant problem that advertisers must com-
bat when to catering smartphones, is the small form factor. Even while the
norm for screen sizes seems to be falling into equilibrium around larger, more
pixel dense screens, they are much smaller than other delivery systems such
as laptops and tablets. This can make typical advertisements such as banners
become overly obtrusive. Ads loose there effectiveness when they are perceived
as a hindrance by the user source ; a very easy line to cross given the small
and precious real estate on a typical smartphone.
Advertisers have been struggling with this issue since the consumers’ adop-
tion of the smartphone. In part, this issue contributes to the large gap between
6consumer usage and advertising dollars spent on mobile which was an esti-
mated ‘opportunity loss’ of $20 billion dollars in May of 2012 [12]. But while
banner placement adverts still frequent many apps, companies are starting to
use less conventional methods for delievering ads. Some techniques include
notifications through the phone’s operating system, rich media advertising,
and audio ads where they can be applied. As the mobile advertising ecosys-
tem matures, the methods of ad delivery will depart from the obtrusive, scaled
down versions of web page ads and become more intimately tied to the phone’s
platform.
Very personal o Make the point that smart phones are typically used by
only one individual, always on and with the user. (FTC Report)
Already, we can see some examples of companies leveraging the smart-
phone’s novel characteristics to create a more seducive advertising impression
on consumers. Emerging technologies are commonly using location based in-
formation to provide services. SquareSpace, a payment system and competitor
to Google wallet, uses location data to identify when a customer has entered
a store and sends that information to the merchant along with previous shop-
ping history so that merchant can better prepare for their transaction Source .
This type of innovation has great implications for efficiency and customer sat-
isfaction, but it also drags along horrendously private data sets that have a
very high appeal to advertising networks.
Location data is the fourth most important aspect to whether a consumer
will interact with an advertisement, falling underneath coupons, previous shop-
ping history and favorite brands [3]. A company called AdNext has already
begun to capitalize on the insight that location data can provide. Using lo-
cation data gathered by wireless access points in one of South Koreas largest
malls, COEX Mall, to build prediction models for the patrons, AdNext was
able to deliver an ad based on the perceived next location of that patron [?].
The benefits of this approach are lucratively appealing to advertising com-
panies and thus with the current legal climate and growth of location based
services, a large market force is created around aggregating personal location
data for the use of direct advertising.
7Conclusion Despite its small screen size, the smartphone is becoming more
and more attractive to advertisers as a platform. One of the best metrics
to measure the success and exposure of advertisements is through what is
known in the industry as the CPI (Cost Per Impression). This is the cost that
advertisers must pay each time that an ad is served. Often this statistic is
reported per one thousand impressions, or cost per milli (CPM). The average
CPM across website banners is a rough statistic as it varies widely based on
niche and exposure, however, for reference, in 2012 it was $2.66 [13]. For
name brand sites such as yahoo.com, cars.com and others, the standard 300 X
250 advertisement is sold for $7.00. Interestingly, advertisers can tack on an
extra $9.00 for behavioral targeted ads [14] Compare this to a recent report
from Opera Software which states that the IPhone pulls in a $2.85 CPM while
phones running the Android OS received an average of $2.10 CPM [15]. The
report continues to extrapolate that rich media, screen resolution and better
user interactivity drive the CPM rate. Certainly, as smartphone technology
continues to grow, so too will these characteristics. Thus, the current trends
suggest that even with its weaknesses, the smartphone will become a more
dominant advertising delivery device in comming years.

Something Needs To Be Done
Users are weary of tracking One of the most troubling aspects to the
issue of privacy on mobile devices is the gaping distance between consumers’
expectations of privacy and the actual reality of privacy on smartphones. In a
survey taken last year, 78 percent of cell phone users think that their personal
data such as contact lists, location data, name, address, etc, is at least as
private as the data on their home computers [2]. This finding has a small caveat
in that it assumes the survey respondents consider their home computers to
be private, but this hardly seems like a controversial claim. If that is the
case, then it would follow that the majority of smartphone users regard their
personal information as secure and private.
In reality, underneath the hood of the mobile ecosystem, many applications
8obtain and use personal information on a regular basis. A study done by The
Wall Street Journal analyzed 101 popular apps and showed that 56 applications
sent the phone’s unique identifier to third parties without notice or consent [16].
Many of these applications also attached many other types of personal data to
the unique identifiers such as contacts, age, and gender before sending them to
various companies. Since then, however, many of the application developers
outed by the publication have adopted privacy policies. While it is beneficial
to have the privacy practices documented in this form, the very mechanism of
notice and choice is failing the average consumer, a point discussed further on.
Growth patterns Despite the fact that consumer awareness is rising with
respect to data collection on mobile platforms, the trends of collection and
aggregation continues to rise [?]. This should not be taken as a suprise as
advertising networks have largely been given the go ahead from a legal per-
spective. The commonly cited case bieng DoubleClick vs Bose determined
difinitively that tracking a user’s behavior amongst multiple contexts cannot
be ciminalized as long as that collection is not tortious FACT CHECK . Cer-
tianly, the demand placed on targeted advertising via ad networks is not going
to go away. Thus, we will continue to see data collection companies compete
and innovate over ways to more efficiently and more preciscly pinpoint your
interests and thus, your suceptibility to interact with an advertisement.
Privacy Dangers One of the more violating practices that is emerging is
the use of location data to serve more relevant ads to consumers.
3.2
Current Policy is not Working
Overview of current protections The current legal landscape sur-
rounding the privacy of mobile data collection is a generaly passive one except
in certain circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the agency
responsible for bringing suits against companies that do not abide by privacy
law. Of course their powers only go as far as current statutes allow. There
are only a few statutes that can be applied to the issues of smartphone data
collection as it occurs in the context of advertising purposes.
9Initially, in an attempt to better understand the industry [?] and possibly
to induce companies to publish privacy policies, the FTC carried out a criminal
investigation on mobile app developers under the pretenses of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In particular, the investigation centered around
the question of weather the collection of a users personal information through
smartphone applications without the user’s notice or consent could be consid-
ered computer fraud. Ultimately the investigation did not lead to any suits,
however it did prompt mobile app developers to take the issue of publishing
privacy policies more seriously not sure .
One case where the FTC had success in bringing actions against mobile
data collection, was in a case involving the Children’s Online Privacy Pro-
tection Act (COPPA). The act requires parental consent before collecting or
sharing any information about any child under the age of 13. The lawsuit
identified a number of companies that clearly marketed their applications to
children and then collected emails and allowed users, mainly children, to post
to the internet in the form of blogs among other things [17]. The defendants
quickly settled to the tune of $50,000.
Why notice and choice is pursued For the general case of tracking
adults through application use however, the FTC does not seem to want
to push its weight around. Although the FTC states five principals in
regards to fair information practices, notice/awareness, choice/consent, ac-
cess/participation, integrity/security and enforcement/redress, they have, in
practice not pursued them equally with the same rigor. In part due to a recog-
nition of the importance of the free flow of information in today’s economy [?]
they have fallen back, almost entirely, to upholding the principals of notice and
choice. Also, the commission’s concept of notice includes in it common themes
of many other fair information privacy principals such as the APEC privacy
framework’s collection limitation and uses of personal information which limits
the collection and use of personal data to only that which is relevant [?]. In
other words, the FTC punts on the concepts of fair use and collection by allow-
ing notices to waive them. Effectually, the commission’s approach allows for
contractual like notices, that can contain anything the drafting party desires,
no matter how “unfair” the practices [18].
10In practice, the FTC has encouraged companies and mobile app developers
to publish privacy policies. This has been apparently for practical purposes
because the main mode of enforcement that the commission has used is going
after companies that have violated their terms of service or privacy policies.
What else can I say..
Failures of notice and choice The theory of notice and choice for pro-
tecting consumer privacy is a wonderful solution to a very real problem. How-
ever, when applied to mobile applications, its practical implementation is truly
horrendous. Notices are often full of legal jargon and verbose to the point that
many consumers do not bother to read them [?]. They also frequently are
not even seen by the consumer, instead implicitly agreed upon through using
the application ( NOT SURE). The concept of choice is also troubling. The
only mechanism of choice that a user is given with regards to the useage of
an application, is to not use that application. Assuming that the user chooses
not to use that application based solely on its policies on personal informa-
tion, there is nearly never an alternative to that application that differs only
in this way. Thus, the privacy concerned user makes not only the choice to
not use the app, but the choice to not use any application that offers a similar
service get sloan’s source .

prescription
Introduction It would not make for reasonable or practical regulation to
force all application developers to adopt strong privacy measures as many firms
make a significant amount of revenue from these sources, likewise, it would not
suffice to do nothing and let the current situation stand as it is. Some users,
needless to say, would not mind giving up their personal data for the trade-off
of using an application, in these situations the current scheme works fine, what
is not acceptable however, are privacy concerned users who wish to use an ap-
plication’s service and are dubiously coaxed into agreeing to that applications
information practices which do not align with his/her expectations. Further-
more, the demand placed on privacy concerned applications by these users is
not a strong enough market force to incite change in the industry. Policy must
11step in to shift this sub-optimal norm to one that satisfies all parties.
Because constructing any sweeping regulation in the mobile data space
would greatly hinder technological advancement [?], and certainly, legislation
should never be tied down to specific technologies,
One of the reasons it is difficult to form good regulation around the issue
of personal data collection is because the situation is not a binary good vs evil
system. There are many forms of personal data collection that are required for
a service to run correctly and for keeping state of a user through a workflow.
FTC should push vendors to regulate apps
4.1
Dangers of Explicit Statutes
One danger that must be mentioned when addressing any regulation regarding
the gathering of smartphone data is the possible societal impacts of limiting
the use of such data. Certainly, not all data mining is evil. Many impor-
tant discoveries and innovations would not have been possible withouth the
unrestricted access to personal data.
In one case, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health carried out a
study in Kenya that consisted of analysing the location data of nearly 15 million
mobile phones to try and understand the infection patterns of malaria [19]. The
study found that human travel carried the infection more so than travel by
mosquitoes, and that the spread of the infection followed stable patterns every
year. Ultimately, the study identified areas where malaria treatment centers
would be most effective, and infection rates have gone down %25 since 2000
due targeted prevention.
Certainly, some uses of mobile data can benifit an entire population, and as
such, any policy should not block the legitimate uses of personal, mobile data
when the user consents to its use. Of course, certain measures should be in
place to ensure that the individuals consent to the use of that data, and that
when it is collected, it is only used for the intended purposes, and is secure
such that no leakage occurs that could harm the individual.
124.2 Building on Existing Statutes to Protect Mobile
Data
Fortunately, there are already in place a number of statutes regarding the
security of data sets containing personal data.
4.3
Technological Solution
Any regulation that uses specific, technological requirements in its language
would become anachronistic rather quickly as technology advances. Thus, any
statute attempting to resolve privacy issues through smartphones specifically
should be avoided. Instead, the FTC can use its influence to push recommen-
dations and best practices onto the mobile ecosystem in order to achive an
industry regulated market. Possibly under threat of creating what is known
as a Trade Rule, the FTC could push mobile phone platforms to create better
privacy controls for the phones that they run on. Since data collection occurs
through the operating system of the mobile phone via permissioned access to
specific data sets, the operating system is in the best position to block the
application of these data.
Apple’s IOS 6 has made great progress in this direction, offering users a
privacy control panel. The panel options start with the different types of data
that may be collected, location and contacts for example, and upon tapping
a specific data type, IOS 6 shows the user all the applications that request
access to that data. The user can then, app by app, grant or revoke access to
that application’s use of the data.
This kind of control is applauded by privacy advocates and is exactly the
kind of innovative solutions that only the platform providers can provide.
The very existence of this kind of control would allow consumers to be
more aware of the data collection practices of certian applications. Currently,
Android users are only made aware of the types of data that an application will
collect when they initially download the application. As mentioned previously,
the user typically does not pay attention to these notices nor have a choice
other than to be excluded from using the service that the application provides if
they disagree with the practices. With good privacy controls in place however,
13the mechanism of notice and choice becomes more effective because the user
can choose to still use the application, but in a way that retains her privacy
preferences.
As the consumer is more easily able to deny applications the data that they
request, application will be pushed to make more clear and consice arguments
for the use of that data. In this way, users will become more aware of the value
that their data holds and a norm will develop around personal, mobile data
that makes it more clear to the consumer that that data is valueable. This, in
turn, would push application developers to make better offers to consumers to
user their data.
4.4
Regulatory Solution
While this type of technological approach works great to protect consumers
against data leakage from specific data sets such as location data, it is inher-
intly limited by the technology that implements it. Of course any data that
the user supplies to the application directly, username, email, date of birth or
application useage statistics, cannot be blocked by the operating system. This
type of limitation would be too sweeping and make it extreamely difficult for
application developers to create useful applications. Another area that any
technological approach could not influence is the process of what happens to
the personal data after it has been collected. These holes in the solution beg
resolution through regulation.
These problems are also good candidates for regulation because any regu-
lation passed in this light would have benifits that carry through more than
just the mobile world. Consider privacy regulation on personal data would to
to the online tracking practices of the current day.
