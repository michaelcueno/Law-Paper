Smartphone and tablet platforms in the US are currently caught in a pri-
vacy snafu with respect to behavioral tracking due to a lack of direct regula-
tion [2] and very little consumer awareness [3]. As more users leave traditional
consumption outlets such as TV, print and even web browser for mobile con-
sumption [4], more research and development goes into procedures for tracking
behaviors on these platforms.
We have seen a healthy debate for consumer protection in the realms of
web browser privacy with the introduction of do not track mechanisms [5] and
default settings which block third party tracking cookies [6]. The success of
these developments can be argued, but the issues seem to be heading in the
right direction. Unfortunately, it is less clear if the same thing can be said
about the privacy issues surrounding the mobile ecosystem. This is increasing
alarming as today s smartphones have access to much more personal data sets
than do your typical web browser, such as contact lists, text messages and
location data.
The void of consumer awareness is begining to be filled with a growing
number of publications that focus on current practices in mobile data collec-
tion. The Wall Street Journal, for example, has devoted an entire series to the
issue [7]. I argue that as consumer awareness increases, so too will the demand
for privacy on mobile platforms. This relationship is supported by a recent
study [8], showing that over the past year, 72 percent of smartphone users
are more concerned about privacy and 81 percent choose to avoid applications
that they think will not protect their privacy.
This paper illustrates the privacy implications that arise from the collection
of personal, mobile data and suggests an approach to solving the issue from a
policy standpoint.

Background
Evolution of Behavioral Tracking
Over the years ad networks have competed to increase the granularity on
their target groups to what is now, in certain cases, an individual bias. A
market has sprung up with devilish speed to compete for access to personal
information which can be sold as profiles to the highest bidders, typically
advertising networks(SOURCE). This practice is known as behavioral data
tracking and it got its start from the third party cookie used in web browsers.
This unique character string lives under the hood of your web browser and
can be used for legitimate reasons such as keeping you logged into a session
with your banks website, but the technology can also be used to collect data
about you across many different sites. The use of cookies to perform behavioral
tracking has exploded in recent years and shows no signs of slowing down.

The migration to smart phones As the use of mobile platforms con-
tinues to grow, we will continue to see the the same practices carried out on
mobile devices. A recent survey found that smartphone and tablet users watch,
on average, 30 percent less TV and consume even less print media. (Source:
ABI) This shift in consumption patterns along with the prospect of advertising
to individuals instead of groups have pushed advertisers to invest heavily into
mobile tracking technologies for the purposes of behavioral advertising.
2.2 Technical Discussion of Behavioral Tracking on
SmartPhones
A majority of tracking on mobile platforms is done through the applications
that users download through their respective application vendors, most com-
monly, the Android Market and the App store from Apple. These applications
often obtain access to permissioned data such as age, gender, location and the
devices unique identifier. For smartphones running the Android OS, this is
typically the International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) and for Apple
products it is the UDID.
4Application developers can access this identifier and send application usage
statistics along with other permissioned data to advertising networks. When
multiple applications send data to the same networks, all using the same iden-
tifier, a secret dossier can be established and maintained by that ad network
for each device(SOURCE).
A troubling aspect to the use of these unique identifiers is that they cannot
be cleared or reset on a device much like cookies on a web browser can. In fact,
some countries have made it illegal to change, or spoof, these unique identifiers
for anti-theft reasons. (SOURCE) This is in part, what makes smartphone
tracking so appealing to advertisers. They are guaranteed a persistent way to
identify an individual across multiple contexts.
At the moment the only technical protection that users have against this
type tracking procedure is through permission awareness from the application
vendors. The Android market for example, informs users what applications
will access via a permissions screen prior to downloading the application. This
is accomplished because Android makes developers request permission to all
the data and resources that the application will require. The problem is that
the average user is unaware of the security and privacy implications behind the
permissions screen. Also, the permissions are commonly not read, and instead
seen as a click through screen to installing an application. (SOURCE)
Mobile Web Browsing An important distiction must be made between
the ways that personal data can be collected on mobile devices. In particular,
data can be gathered through web browsing and through using applications
installed from third parties. Although IOS blocks third party cookies, most
android browsers along with Firefox s mobile browser do not [9]. Even in the
case where thrid party cookies are disabled, there are various ways in which
profilers can track a user through the mobile web. These techniques include
‘device fingerprinting’ [10] and leveraging a loophole in the Safari browser [11]
among a few other methods [9].
These two seperate domains cause problems for advertising networks and
consumers alike. Since they are indeed disjoint domains, a single user can
appear to be two different users on the same device, one profile for mobile web
and one for application use. So far the only documented way of connecting
5these two profiles is by having a user click through an advertisement which
loads in that user browser, thus tying the two profiles together [9]. However,
the majority of data gathered in the mobile realm is through application use
and not through browsing source. For this reason along with the fact that
behavioral tracking through mobile web browsing is not a novel issue that is
brought up through analysing privacy in the mobile ecosystem, for the remain-
der of this paper, we will only concern ourselves with the application tracking
domain.
The Future of SmartPhone Tracking (Real time location data)
The future in smartphone tracking holds some concerning characteristics for
consumer privacy. Emerging technologies are commonly using location based
information to provide services. SquareSpace, a payment system and com-
petitor to Google wallet, uses location data to identify when a customer has
entered a store and send that information to the merchant along with previous
shopping history so that merchant can better prepare for their transaction.
This type of innovation has great implications for efficiency and customer sat-
isfaction, but it also drags along horrendously private data sets that have a
very high appeal to advertising networks.
Location data is the fourth most important aspect to whether a consumer
will interact with an advertisement, falling underneath coupons, previous shop-
ping history and favorite brands (SOURCE ABI). A company called AdNext
used location data gathered by wireless access points in one of South Koreas
largest malls, COEX Mall, to build prediction models for the patrons in order
to deliver an ad based on the perceived next location of that patron. (AD-
NEXT) The benefits of this approach are lucratively appealing to advertising
companies and thus with the current legal climate and growth of location based
services, a large market force is created around aggregating personal location
data for the use of direct advertising.
Differences between Web Browser Tracking and Smartphone tracking
The difference between traditional behavioral tracking through the use of
third party cookies and the way that it is done via smartphones and tablets
through applications is an important technical point that has implications on
policy and privacy. In the case of cookies, the user has the ability to delete
6them and thus clear out the data that tracks them. NOT REALLY
In some cases, companies have used the unorthodoxed flash cookie, also
known as a super cookie, which is able to respawn regular cookies after they
have been deleted
o Make the point that smart phones are typically used by only one indi-
vidual, always on and with the user. (FTC Report)

Evaluation
A study done by The Wall Street Journal analyzed 101 popular apps and
showed that 56 applications sent these unique identifiers to third parties with-
out notice or consent. (WSJ1)
Mobile Web Browsing TODO: Make distinction between web browsing
and app usage, why this paper only deals with app usage.
