Users are weary of tracking One of the most troubling aspects to the
issue of privacy on mobile devices is the gaping distance between consumers’
expectations of privacy and the actual reality of privacy on smartphones. In
a survey carried out in 2012, 78 percent of cell phone users think that their
personal data such as contact lists, location data, name, address, etc, is at
least as private as the data on their home computers [2]. This finding has a
small caveat in that it assumes the survey respondents consider their home
computers to be private, but this hardly seems like a controversial claim. If
that is the case, then it would follow that the majority of smartphone users
regard their personal information as secure and private.
In reality, underneath the hood of the mobile ecosystem, many applications
obtain and use personal information on a regular basis. A study done by The
Wall Street Journal analyzed 101 popular apps and showed that 56 applications
sent the phone’s unique identifier to third parties without notice or consent [?].
Many of these applications also attached many other types of personal data to
the unique identifiers such as contacts, age, and gender before sending them to
7various companies. Since then, however, many of the application developers
outed by the publication have adopted privacy policies. While it is beneficial
to have the privacy practices documented in this form, the very mechanism of
notice and choice is failing the average consumer, a point discussed further on.
Growth patterns Despite the fact that consumer awareness is rising with
respect to data collection on mobile platforms, the trends of collection and
aggregation continues to rise [?]. This can not be taken as suprise as advertising
networks have largely been given the go ahead from a legal perspective. The
commonly cited case bieng DoubleClick vs Bose determined difinitively that
tracking a user’s behavior amongst multiple contexts cannot be ciminalized as
long as that collection is not tortious FACT CHECK . Certianly, the demand
placed on targeted advertising via ad networks is not going to go away. Thus,
we will continue to see data collection companies compete and innovate over
ways to more efficiently and more preciscly pinpoint your interests and thus,
your suceptibility to interact with an advertisement.
Privacy Dangers One of the more violating practices that is emerging is
the use of location data to serve more relevant ads to consumers.

Current Policy is not Working
Overview of current protections The current legal landscape sur-
rounding the privacy of mobile data collection is a generaly passive one except
in certain circumstances. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the agency
responsible for bringing suits against companies that do not abide by privacy
law. Of course their powers only go as far as current statutes allow. There
are only a few statutes that can be applied to the issues of smartphone data
collection as it occurs in the context of advertising purposes.
Initially, in an attempt to better understand the industry [?] and possibly
to induce companies to publish privacy policies, the FTC carried out a criminal
investigation on mobile app developers under the pretenses of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In particular, the investigation centered around
the question of weather the collection of a users personal information through
8a smartphone without the users notice or consent would be covered by the
CFAA. Ultimately the investigation did not lead to any suits, however it did
prompt mobile app developers to take the issue of publishing privacy policies
more serioiusly not sure .
One case where the FTC had success in bringing actions against mobile
data collection, was in a case involving the Children’s Online Privacy Pro-
tection Act (COPPA). The act requires parental consent before collecting or
sharing any information about any child under the age of 13. The lawsuit
identified a number of companies that clearly marketed their applications to
children and then collected emails and allowed users, mainly children, to post
to the interent in the form of blogs among other things [?]. The defendants
quickly settled to the tune of $50,000.
Why notice and choice is pursued For the general case of tracking
adults through application use, the FTC has fallen back to the concept of a few more words to make up for what i just lost
