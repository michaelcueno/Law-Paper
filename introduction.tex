\section {Introduction}

Smartphone and tablet platforms in the US have been caught in a privacy snafu with respect to behavioral tracking due to a lack of direct regulation \cite{Priv2013} and very little consumer awareness \cite{Jenn2012}. As more users leave traditional consumption outlets such as TV, print and even web browser for mobile consumption \cite{Abi2012}, more research and development goes into procedures for tracking behaviors on these platforms.

We have seen a healthy debate for consumer protection in the realms of web browser privacy with the introduction of do not track mechanisms \cite{W3C2012} and default settings which block third party tracking cookies \cite{Moz2013}. The success of these developments can be argued, but the issues seem to be heading in the right direction. Unfortunately, it is less clear if the same thing can be said about the privacy issues in the mobile arena. 
Attribution for this can go, in part, to a lack of consumer awareness of the tracking practices that are carried out on mobile devices\cite{?}. 
This is increasing alarming as today$'$s smartphones have access to much more personal data sets than do your typical web browser, such as contact lists, text messages and location data to name a few. 

% The attribution for this void is can be placed on a lack of consumer awareness and a cold legal climate surrounding the use and aggregation of personal data acquired through mobile platforms.

The void of consumer awareness is begining to be filled with a growing number of publications that focus on current practices in mobile data collection. The Wall Street Journal, for example, has devoted an entire series to the issue \cite{Wsj2013}. I argue that as consumer awareness increases, so too will the demand for privacy on mobile platforms. This relationship is supported by a recent study\cite{Trust2013}, showing that over the past year, 72 percent of smartphone users are more concerned about privacy and 81 percent choose to avoid applications that they think will not protect their privacy. 

This paper illustrates the privacy implications that arise from the collection of personal, mobile data and suggests an approach to solving the issue from a policy standpoint.
